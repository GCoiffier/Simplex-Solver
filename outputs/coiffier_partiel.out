OUTPUT 
The input linear program is: 

Maximize  1x_1 + 1x_2 
Such that -2x_1 -1x_2  <= -8
          -1x_1 + 2x_2  <= 0
          6x_1 -5x_2  <= 45
          1x_1  <= 20
          x_1, x_2 are non-negative

An optimal solution is : x_1 = 90/7, x_2 = 45/7
The value of the objective for this solution is : 135/7
The number of pivots is : 3
The pivot rule used : MaxCoeff
The calculation took 0.002 seconds
