OUTPUT 
The input linear program is: 

Maximize  1x_1 + 1x_3 
Such that 1x_1  <= 1
          1x_2 -1x_3  <= 1
          x_1, x_2, x_3 are non-negative

The initial tableau is : 

1   0   1   0   0    |  0
----------------------------
1   0   0   1   0    |  1
0   1   -1  0   1    |  1

The point (0,...,0) is a feasible solution. Only one phase is needed

The entering variable is x_1
The leaving variable is x_4 

0   0   1   -1  0    |  -1
-----------------------------
1   0   0   1   0    |  1
0   1   -1  0   1    |  1

The entering variable is x_3
This linear program is UNBOUNDED
